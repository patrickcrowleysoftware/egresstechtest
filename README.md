Bulls and Cows game Web Application

The launch page from the browser is:
http://localhost:8080/BullsAndCows/BullsAndCowsForm.html
and it should be self-explanatory what to do from there. I’ve added just some basic input validation and echoed the secret number to the screen just for checking/debugging, obviously to be removed once finished. 
Also I added some useful console debug output.

Some items to note that I would have done had I more time (away from other tech tests that I am currently doing):

-	Part 2 is not all completed – I had thought that due to delays already, that it was better to send you back something now to give you an idea of my coding approach, styles, etc.
I have attempted to give suggestions with TODOs how it might be finished – other than doing just the “brute force” method of the computer trying all the numbers until 4 Bulls are obtained.

-	Ideally, once Part 2 is all working, I would then further refactor the number-specific computational code away into a separate Java project and class, and then just leave the servlet specific code in the servlet class, to obtain low coupling and high code cohesion.
